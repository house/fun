IT IS PITCH BLACK. YOU ARE STANDING INSIDE THE TITTLE OF A 
QUESTION MARK. 

> feel

YOUR STOMACH IS KNOTTED WITH ANXIETY. YOUR HEART THUNDERS 
IN YOUR CHEST.

> listen

SOMEWHERE IN FRONT OF YOU, A MACHINE IS HUMMING SOFTLY TO 
ITSELF.

> listen to machine

YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH, CLOSE YOUR EYES, AND LISTEN. THE 
HUMMING GROWS LOUDER, WASHING OVER YOU IN WAVES. IT DRAGS 
YOU TO A DIFFERENT FREQUENCY. YOU FEEL FUZZY, COMFORTED. 
YOU OPEN YOUR EYES.

DUSK. YOU ARE SUBMERGED IN A SWIMMING POOL, STILL HOLDING 
YOUR BREATH.

> look

YOU LOOK UP. RAIN IS DOTTING THE WATER'S SURFACE, RIPPLING 
ACROSS A DARKENING SKY. IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND SURREAL.

> feel

A SENSE OF TREMENDOUS WELL-BEING COLLECTS IN YOUR CHEST.

> feel

EVERY LIMB TINGLES IN RECOGNITION OF THE OVERWHELMING 
BEAUTY AND MEANING IN THE UNIVERSE.

> feel

YOU WANT TO STAY IN THIS MOMENT, IN 1995, FOREVER. IT'S 
GETTING DARK.

> feel

YOUR MOTHER IS EXPECTING YOU HOME SOON. THE POOL LIGHTS 
KICK ON.

> feel

YOU ARE RUNNING OUT OF AIR. GO HOME.

> feel

GO HOME.

> feel

GO HOME.

> please

GO HOME.
